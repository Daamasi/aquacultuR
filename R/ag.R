#' Absolute Growth (AG)
#' 
#' Calculates the Absolute Growth
#' 
#' A function that calculates the Absolute Growth (AG), also denoted as
#' Absolute Weight Gain (AWG) based on the Initial Body weight (IBW;
#' initWeight) in gram (g) and the Final Body Weight (FBW; finalWeight)
#' in gram (g).
#' 
#' @param m_start numeric; value providing the initial weight in grams.
#' @param m_end numeric; value providing the final weight in grams.
#' 
#' @return returns a numeric value that is the AG.
#' 
#' @note The AG, also termed Absolute Weight Gain (AWG), is the weight that was
#' gained within the duration of a growth trial. It does by default not
#' distinguish between weight gain in form of dry matter or water.
#' 
#' AG = FBW - IBW
#' 
#' The IBW is subtracted from the FBW.
