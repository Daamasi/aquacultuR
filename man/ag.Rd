weight_gain(m_start, m_end)
}

\description{
Calculates the Absolute Growth
}
\details{
A function that calculates the Absolute Growth (AG), also denoted as
Absolute Weight Gain (AWG) based on the Initial Body weight (IBW;
m_start) in gram (g) and the Final Body Weight (FBW; m_end)
in gram (g).
}
\examples{
data(weight2)

dplyr::mutate(weight2, AG = ag(W_start, W_end))
