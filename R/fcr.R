#' Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR)
#' 
#' A function that calculates the Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) based on
#' the Initial Body weight (IBW; initWeight) in gram (g), the Final Body
#' Weight (FBW; finalWeight) in gram (g), the total Feed Intake (FI; feedIntake)
#' in gram and the dry matter (DM; dryMatter) content of the feed in percent.
#' (duration) in days (d).
#' 
#' @param m_start numeric; value that is providing the initial weight in
#' grams.
#' @param m_end numeric; value that is providing the final weight in
#' grams.
#' @param fi numeric; value providing the total feed intake in grams
#' during the experiment.
#' @param dm numeric; value indicating the dry matter content of the
#' feed. The value must be within the interval of (0:1).
#' 
#' @return returns a numeric value that is the FCR.
#' 
#' @note The Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR) describes the amount of feed on dry matter
#' (DM) basis that is required to gain 1 kg of body weight on wet weight basis.
#' 
#' FCR = (FI * DM) / (FBW - IBW)
#' 
#' The FI is multiplied by the DM of the feed to calculate the true FI.
#' This is then divided by the weight increase during the experimental
#' period to calculate the amount of feed consumed per unit of weight
#' increase.
