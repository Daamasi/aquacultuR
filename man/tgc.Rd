\title{Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC).}
\usage{
tgc(m_start, m_end, duration, temp)
}
\arguments{
\item{m_start}{a numeric value that is providing the initial weight in
grams.}

\item{m_end}{a numeric value that is providing the final weight in
grams.}

\item{duration}{a numeric value that is providing the duration of the
experiment in days.}

\item{temp}{a numeric value that is providing the average temperature during
the experiment in degrees Celsius.}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value that is the TGC.
}
\description{
A function that calculates Thermal Growth Coefficient (TGC) based on
 the Initial Body weight (IBW; initWeight) in gram (g), the Final Body
 Weight (FBW; finalWeight) in gram (g) and the average water temperature
 during the duration of the trial.
}
\note{
The TGC is an alternative growth metric for fishes, describing the increase
in bodyweight over a period of time. It is suitable for poikilothermic
animals due to its standardisation for temperature. It should, however, be
taken into account, that the temperature during the experiment should remain
within the optimum range.

TGC = (FBW[g]^(1/3)) - IBW[g]^(1/3))) / duration * Temp[degreeCelsius]) * 1000

The cubic root of the initial body weight is subtracted from
the cubic root of the final body weight. The term is then
divided by the product of the duration and the average temperature and
multiplied by 1000 to convert the result into a larger number.
