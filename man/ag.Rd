\title{Absolute Growth (AG)}
\usage{
ag(m_start, m_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{m_start}{numeric; value providing the initial weight in grams.}

\item{m_end}{numeric; value providing the final weight in grams.}
}
\value{
returns a numeric value that is the AG.
}
\description{
Calculates the Absolute Growth
}
\details{
A function that calculates the Absolute Growth (AG), also denoted as
Absolute Weight Gain (AWG) based on the Initial Body weight (IBW;
initWeight) in gram (g) and the Final Body Weight (FBW; finalWeight)
in gram (g).
}
\note{
The AG, also termed Absolute Weight Gain (AWG), is the weight that was
gained within the duration of a growth trial. It does by default not
distinguish between weight gain in form of dry matter or water.

AG = FBW - IBW

The IBW is subtracted from the FBW.
}
\examples{
data(weight2)

dplyr::mutate(weight2, AG = ag(W_start, W_end))
